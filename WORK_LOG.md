| Jan 23 |  3:30-4:30 PM  |                                                                                                                                                      I honestly don't have much of an idea of where to go with this problem set. At first, I had lowkey thought of using something like an adjacency matrix to keep track of combinations of coins I had already used. Pretty much spent the whole class just brainstorming on a google doc. |
| Jan 27 |  8:55-9:55 AM  |                                                                                                         I talked it out with some of my classmates and we came up with the idea to try and approach this problem by trying to exclude some coins when figuring out combinations. For example, turning coins(10, {5,1,4} into coins(19,{1,4}. I don't know where I would store the visited values but I was thinking of something like a TST. |
| Jan 28 |     2-3 PM     |                                                                                So the hint I got from Mr. Blick was that instead of excluding we should try including. I spent this class time trying to pseudocode and then finally actually coding out the recursive algorithm. I also changed my TST to an array list since I think it would be easier to keep track of, but I haven't figured out how to keep track of certain patterns. |
| Feb 5  | 10:45-11:55 AM | So a lot has happened in the last week. I have not had an opportunity to work on this problem set due to me getting very sick over the weekend. However, in hindsight, I was approaching this problem very wrong, instead of only including, this problem set wants you to use both including and excluding. I spent this time working on my tabulation approach since I seem to understand it a little bit better than memoization for now. |
| Feb 7  |     3-4 PM     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I spent this time today finishing up my code for the tabulation approach, I spent a while trying to figure out why I was getting a index overflow error which I can't figure out even right now. |
| Feb 9  |    10-11 AM    |                                                                                                                                                                                                               Since I couldn't figure out the tabulation issue, I decided to just spend this time coding out the memoization approach, I have an idea to change the array to an array list to make it easier to manipulate in my base cases. |
| Feb 12 | 10:55-11:55 AM |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I ditched the array list idea and just created an int index to keep track of which part of the array I've been looking at. However, I'm getting the same index overflow error and it is driving me insane please help me. |
| Feb 13 |  10-10:45 AM   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I checked in with Mr. Blick about my errors and with his help I was able to figure out how to fix my code. |
